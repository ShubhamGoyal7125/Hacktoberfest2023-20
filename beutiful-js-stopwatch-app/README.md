# Stopwatch App

This is a stopwatch I have created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

A stop watch is a device used to measure speed or duration in fractions of a second, typically for sporting or athletic events. In this project I had made a web application of stopwatch. It has following features

-   It shows time in HH:MM:SS format
-   Starts from 00:00:00
-   User can Start, Pause, Reset the timer

## Additional Features

1. Fully Mobile Responsive App
2. Play/Stop button changes dynamically
3. Simple design UI
4. Works Globally i.e no effect of timezone
